# Dice_Game
This is a simple Dice Game project . It uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to simulate the rolling of two dice.  Features Two dice are rolled on page refresh.  Each die displays a number between 1 and 6.  A message is shown declaring Player 1, Player 2, or a Draw, based on which die has a higher value.
